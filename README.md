# CS-305-Software-Security

The client is Artemis Financial, which is a financial institution looking to update there system to be up-to-date with the lates software and security for their customers. They were looking to have the security in their software to be assessed and updated to be more current and secure. Having a high since of security is important to them as they are a financial institution, which would handle people’s sensitive information.

One thing that I did well in noticing was that they had a lack of restrictions and such within the code making it so that people or groups can do more then they would need. Adding more restrictions based on security level would be good in keeping with the principle of least privileges. When increasing the security of the system, implementing a cipher algorithm was important as well. In this code I ended up using SHA-256 which is currently a highly used cipher algorithm because of it’s security. 

After refactoring the code for the software, I ran the dependency check again to check for known security issues and corrected or suppressed it depending on the result of the problem. When working on this project the many resources provided by the class was very useful, including sites like oracle where very invaluable. There where also times that I became stuck on an issue within the code and StackOverflow was very useful as well.

In this assignment, implementing a checksum verification was extremely useful and important in making sure that you have successfully implemented the cipher algorithm, as well as the creation of self-signed certificates. These both are important in creating secure and safe software and websites.
